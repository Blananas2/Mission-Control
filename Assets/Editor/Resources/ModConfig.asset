  description: 'Mission Control v1.0


    A utility module used to alter how missions are usually played. This is how I
    will add gimmicks to missions instead of hiding it in other modules'' code. I''ll
    also be accepting requests if anyone else wants to use it.


    Currently only supports changing the bomb''s timer, but more features are planned,
    such as hiding modules and changing game music.
